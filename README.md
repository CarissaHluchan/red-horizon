### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
- This was our first time working with a large-scale API, through the use of PostMan we were able to test various endpoints to get back the data we needed to display images for each of our interactive targets.
- We taught ourselves TypeScript reading through and implementing documentation.
- Learned advanced CSS techniques including hover, transform, and displaying <span> text
- Did research and implemented an extension to thoroughly test hover interaction in Cypress
