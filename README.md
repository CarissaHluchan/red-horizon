### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
Mars exploration app for curious learners to discover images of the surface features of Mars, explore its moons, and images from the Mars rover expeditions.

Picture a time when you were a kid and you were at one of those interactive museums. Thereâ€™s all the animal stuff witch is cool, but then you see the history section and they had the controls of a train and you could pull the whistle and that was cool too but it was just, missing something. Then you saw a massive model of the rocket. There was probably a tv nearby that had footage of Astronauts walking to the shuttle and then shaking as they blasted off into a sky that was blue to start, then faded into a deep midnight blue before fading into complete darkness which was in wild contrast to the shuttles white exterior. Then camera switches to show the earth, massive, but shrinking behind the craft. Then the propulsion cuts out and itâ€™s silent as the astronauts begin to float and prepare for the second stage of their mission. Then you saw models of other planets and possible spacecrafts for the future, and then you heard and understood that even light has a speed and the space it has to cross is so massive that it takes 8 minutes to get to us, and suddenly; anything and everything was possible.
	
  While we havenâ€™t created a museum, we aimed to capture that feeling of wonder and exploration. We know more about the surface of mars than we do the ocean floor, and NASAâ€™s API shows that. We have access to thousands and thousands of data points from mineral content to panoramic views of martian regions we havenâ€™t seen yet because we barely saw the highlights through whatever media we interact with. We want to remedy the mindless scrolling with scrolling that might offer something, more substantial and wonder-inspiring.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This group project took 3 Turing students roughly 8 days or 45 hours to complete. We were in our 14th week of intensive front-end web development training.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
This application was built by:
[Carissa Hluchan](https://github.com/CarissaHluchan),
[Charles Banks](https://github.com/DRIF7ER), and

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- Incorporating a new technology that we researched and learned on our own -TypeScript
- Gain competency with React fundamentals
- Test React components & asynchronous JS
- Practice refactoring
- Create a multi-page UX using Router

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
- This was our first time working with a large-scale API, through the use of PostMan we were able to test various endpoints to get back the data we needed to display images for each of our interactive targets.
- We taught ourselves TypeScript reading through and implementing documentation.
- Learned advanced CSS techniques including hover, transform, and displaying <span> text
- Did research and implemented an extension to thoroughly test hover interaction in Cypress
